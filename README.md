Like you can read in the docx file, The app has three "faces"
One is the simplest, in the form, that has a console based UI.
The second is with a similar logic, but with a more advanced UI using javaFX and sceneMaker.
The third is an implementation of the ABS project with a JavaFX UI but with an **advanced Client-Server Architecture**, The backend was written using Apache Tomcat's Java Servlet solutions.
